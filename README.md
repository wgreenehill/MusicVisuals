# Music Visualiser Project

Name: William Greene-Hill

Student Number: C19412942

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
My assignment is based off the sun in the sky, where the circle is the sun on the bottom left of the canvas and the rays the sun omits are the frequency band that thread the beat of the song that plays when ran, HeroPlanet!

# Instructions
Run the program and enjoy!

# How it works
When run, the program will play the mp3 file. I have drawn a frequency band around the circle (the sun) and they will grow and shrink in tandem with the beat using FFT.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
